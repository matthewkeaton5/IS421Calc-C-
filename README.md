# Console Calculation
Matthew Keaton, Professor Keith Williams

# Purpose

The goal of this project was for the calculator to take in two values. These two values could be as simple as 1 and 2, or a list of numbers that need to be added together in one step. This function is designed in order to minimize the amount of entries needed when using the application. In this project multiple design patterns were used to better my understanding of C# as a whole. I also utilized delegates/events, lambda functions, and more. These Object Oriented Design Patterns include, Abstract Factories, Builders, and Dependency Injection. All of this was done while maintaining SOLID coding practices as well. The definition for solid can be found below.

* **Single-responsibility**: "A class should have one, and only one, responsibility."

* **Open-closed Principle**:  "Software should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

* **Liskov Subsitution**:  "If any module is using a Base class then the reference to that Base class can be replaced with a Derived class without affecting the        functionality of the module."

* **Interface Segregation**: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

* **Dependency Inversion**: "Depend on abstractions not on concrete implementations."
 
# Lambda Expressions
As with many calculators people develop code for there is going to be functions designated for handling all of the different operations.
